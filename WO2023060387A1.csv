In particular, the alginate is selected from alkali metal salts or ammonium salts of alginic acid. The alginate is water-soluble.
Alginic acid, a natural substance obtained from brown algae or from certain bacteria, is a polyuronic acid composed of two uronic acids linked together via 1, 4- glycoside bonds: B-D-mannuronic acid (M) and a-L-glucuronic acid (G).
Alginic acid is capable of forming water-soluble salts (alginates) with alkali metals such as sodium, potassium or lithium, or ammonia. These alginates are water-soluble in aqueous medium at pH 4 but dissociate into alginic acid at a pH below 4.

2) putting one bottle under the sunlight, one bottle at room temperature, one bottle into a refrigerator at 4°C, one bottle into an oven at 37 °C and one bottle into an oven at 45 °C (for stability tests at different temperatures), and one bottle into an oven with the temperature cycling from -20 °C to 20 °C (for cycle stability); and
3) observing the samples’ appearance after 2 months for stability tests at different temperatures, 10 days for cycle stability, 24 hours for sunlight stability.
